            <h3>Childhood</h3>
            <p>I grew up with my grandmother in the province where riding my bicycle, 
            going to the fishpond to look for fish to cook, and cutting classes with my childhood friends was my source of happiness.</p>

            <h3>Teenage Life</h3>
            <p>During my teenage life, my addiction for staying in the computer shop gradually grew.
            Until I met my first and greatest love in a mobile game "Call of Duty". We shared three wonderful years together.</p>

            <h3>Adulthood</h3>
            <p>After graduating in senior high school, we fell apart. As of today, I spend mostly watching anime and reading manga. My interest in the things I used to do, namely hanging out with friends,
            doing some kind of side quests, playing video games almost daily, has faded away.</p>
